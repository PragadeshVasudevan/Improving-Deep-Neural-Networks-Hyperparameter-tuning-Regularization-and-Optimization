# Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks-Hyperparameter-tuning-Regularization-and-Optimization
Hyperparameters, Regularization, Optimization

Instructor: Andrew Ng

Second Week Programming assignment and projects on deep learning course.

This assignments are very easy if you have gone through all the videos. I would say that all the regularization, dropouts, optimization, hyperparameters tuning or default values are pretty much interesting.
